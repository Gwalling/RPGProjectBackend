Visual RPG Game Frontend

This is the backend portion of the Visual Fantasy RPG Game. 

This game serves to take the player through an epic land of adventure and mysticism in the vein of old dungeons 
and dragons game and presents it in a dozen locations represented through edited pictures and animations.

The battle system proves the crux of the game allowing the player to fight, flee, steal, or heal while encountering new animations and monsters.

Furthermore, equipment and treasure proves a pinnacle component of the game as without proper thought and strategy as to the implementation of them,
the player will not progress far.
